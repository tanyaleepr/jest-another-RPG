# Jest - Another RPG

![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

In this project, I created a command-line role-playing game (RPG) in which the user battles a series of enemies whose health and stats can be sustained by taking a potion. The game will create new objects using JavaScript constructor functions, and will also implement basic code tests using the Jest framework.
